"""
Example of a custom MQTT component.

Shows how to communicate with MQTT. Follows a topic on MQTT and updates the
state of an entity to the last message received on that topic.

Also offers a service 'set_state' that will publish a message on the topic that
will be passed via MQTT to our message received listener. Call the service with
example payload {"new_state": "some new state"}.

Configuration:

To use the mqtt_example component you will need to add the following to your
configuration.yaml file.

mqtt_basic:
  topic: "home-assistant/mqtt_example"
